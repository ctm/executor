/*
 * This file handles the mechanics of verifying serial number, authorization
 * key pairs and also extracting out the expiration date and numbe of CPUS
 * that is encoded into them.  It doesn't handle the opposite direction, given
 * a serial number, an expiration date and a number of CPUs, a valid
 * authorization key can be created.  That functionality is in a separate
 * file -- one that's not part of Executor -- since we want to make it harder
 * for hackers to reverse engineer their own "getcode" program.  We do make
 * a bunch of intermediate routines available for the getcode program so that
 * we don't have duplicated source code.
 *
 * A serial numbers is a 32-bit quantity that is displayed as a 10-digit
 * unsigned decimal number.  Internally we use the first seven digits as
 * a customer number and the last three digits as encoding of the class of
 * license:
 *
 *         c,ccc,ccc,soo, c = customer number, s = sub-class (e.g. student,
 *		faculty, commercial, etc.), o = operating sytem.
 *
 * This encoding of the serial number is not important to the routines that
 * are in this file.
 *
 * An authorization key decrypts into a serial number, a number of CPUs
 *	supported, an Executor major revision number, and an expiration date.
 *
 * These fields aren't represented as decimal digits, since the end-user never
 * sees them.
 *	
 *	serial number:			32 bits
 *	number of CPUs supported:	16 bits
 *	Executor major revision number:  4 bits
 *	Expiration date:		 8 bits (number of months
 *						 beyond 95-01-01, 0 = none)
 *	Unassigned (must be zero):	 5 bits
 *	_______________________________________
 *	Total:				65 bits
