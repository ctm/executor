-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CWSDPMI was written to provide DPMI services for V2 of DJGPP.  It currently
does not support 16-bit DPMI applications or DOOM.  It does support virtual
memory and hardware interrupt reflection from real mode to protected mode.
DJGPP V1.1x and RSX applications will also run using this server, which can be
used to provide enhanced control over hardware interrupts.

Please report any applications which do not work properly to the address above.

Directions for use (server can be used in either of two different ways):

1) "cwsdpmi" alone with no parameters will terminate and stay resident 
   FOR A SINGLE DPMI PROCESS.  This means it unloads itself when your 
   DPMI application exits.  This mode is useful in software which needs
   DPMI services, since CWSDPMI can be exec'ed and then will unload on exit.

2) "cwsdpmi -p" will terminate and stay resident until you remove it.
   It can be loaded into UMBs with LH.  "cwsdpmi -u" will unload the TSR.

I would like to give special thanks to DJ Delorie who wrote the original 
GO32 code on which CWSDPMI is based.  Morten Welinder also provided and 
improved much of the code in this program.
