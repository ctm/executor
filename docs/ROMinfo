Differences Between PowerPC and 68K

	Synthetic CPU

	PowerPC Numerics

Additions:

	Mixed Mode Manager

	Code Fragment Manager

	Exception Manager

Potential Problems:

	Decompression -- could be tricky to reverse engineer, could
		technically even be patented

Major sections that haven't been written

	serial port support

	networking

		AppleTalk

		TCP/IP
	
	INIT/CDEV support

	Internationalization (Script Manager)

	Edition Manager,

	Process Manager

	Start Manager

	Power Manager

	SCSI Manager

Sections that need improvement

	sound

	AppleEvents

	ADB (Apple Desktop Bus)

	Filesystem

		Alias Manager

		PBExchangeFiles,

	Balloon Help

	Font Manager

		True Type fonts

		OutlineMetrics, FlushFonts,

		PrJobMerge,

	Color

		AddComp, DelComp

		DisposCCursor

		NewTempScreenBuffer

		CharExtra
		SaveFore, RestoreFore, SaveBack, RestoreBack

	Picture Utilities

		DisposePictInfo, RecordPictInfo, RecordPixMapInfo,
		RetrievePictInfo, NewPictInfo, GetPictInfo

Minor work that needs to be done

	GetStdFilterProc, SetDialogCancelItem, SetDialogTracksCursor,

	WritePartialResource, SetResourceSize

	Temporary Memory Manager

	Stylized Text Edit

	GDeviceChanged, PortChanged, PixPatChanged and CTabChanged need work

	GetCPixel doesn't work for bpp > 8.

	OpenCPicture just calls OpenPicture.

	RestoreDeviceClut needs work

	inverse color table routines don't do a good job of discriminating
	between colors that are close to each other.
