Differences between the services Executor provides and those available
with System 7.0

	limited serial port access

	no low-level device access (e.g. SCSI manager, power manager)

	no AppleTalk

	no INITs or CDEVs

	most of AppleEvents unimplemented

	most of ADB traps unimplemented

	most of the AliasManager unimplemented

	no balloon help

	GetStdFilterProc, SetDialogCancelItem,
		and SetDialogTracksCursor unimplemented

	no Edition Manager

	OutlineMetrics and FlushFonts unimplemented

	PBExchangeFiles unimplemented

	limited support for the icon suite routines

	International Utilities and Script Manager implementation incomplete
		(and US-specific)

	some missing low level printing calls
		(e.g. DraftBits, NoDraftBits, GetRotn)

	PrJobMerge unimplemented

	printing is black and white only

	all but trivial process manager routines unimplemented

	AddComp, DelComp unimplemented

	DisposCCursor uimplemented

	NewTempScreenBuffer uninmplemented

	CharExtra unimplemented

	SaveFore, RestoreFore, SaveBack, RestoreBack unimplemented

	DisposePictInfo, RecordPictInfo, RecordPixMapInfo, RetrievePictInfo,
		NewPictInfo, GetPictInfo, unimplemented

	WritePartialResource, SetResourceSize unimplemented

	ShutDwnInstall, ShutDwnRemove unimplemented

	sound manager only implements sampled sound

	SetStylScrap, TECustomHook, TENumStyles unimplemented

	TempTopMem unimplemented

GDeviceChanged, PortChanged, PixPatChanged and CTabChanged are poorly
implemented.  GetCPixel doesn't work for bpp > 8.  OpenCPicture just
calls OpenPicture.  RestoreDeviceClut's implementation is shakey.
