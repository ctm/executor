The skel directory contains a single directory "volume", which is the
read-only template used to create an initial ExecutorVolume when one
can't be found at Executor's startup.  ExecutorVolume at minimum needs
a "System Folder" directory that contains an Executor compatible "System"
file (traditionally represented as a pair of files "System" and "%System").
